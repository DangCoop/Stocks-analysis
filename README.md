# Stocks-analysis
## Project Overview
---
***Background***

Steve asked me to analyze a group of 12 green stocks to support his parent’s investment decisions. To do so, I gladly designed an interactive, user friendly, workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume and return on investment (ROI).

He loved being able to analyze each stock at the click of a button and now wants to expand his research beyond the 12 green stocks.

***Purpose***

Steve wants to analyze a higher number of stocks and I am here to help. This may increase the amount of time it takes the analysis to produce results and I’d like to maintain or, even better, improve it! Now I will take advantage of any opportunity to improve the workbooks efficiency by refactoring the VBA coding. To ensure that I am going in the right direction, I will compare the new execution time with the original workbook.

***Results***
