# Stocks-analysis
## Project Overview
---
***Background***

Steve asked me to analyze a group of 12 green stocks to support his parent’s investment decisions. To do so, I gladly designed an interactive, user friendly, workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume and return on investment (ROI).

He loved being able to analyze each stock at the click of a button and now wants to expand his research beyond the 12 green stocks.

***Purpose***

Steve wants to analyze a higher number of stocks and I am here to help. This may increase the amount of time it takes the analysis to produce results and I’d like to maintain or, even better, improve it! Now I will take advantage of any opportunity to improve the workbooks efficiency by refactoring the VBA coding. To ensure that I am going in the right direction, I will compare the new execution time with the original workbook.

***Results***

As it can be seen just by glancing through the findings, the 2017 performance was considerably better as there is a lot more green to be seen in the table. This means there are more returns that came out positive. This is specially true for stocks such as Daqo, that in 2017 came out with a return of 199.4% and in 2018 of -62.6%. Similarly, this same happened for most of the stocks including Atlantica Yield (ticker: AY), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), First Solar (FSLR), Hannon Armstrong Inc. (HASI), Jinko Solar (JKS), SolarEdge (SEDG), SunPower (SPWR), and Vivint Solar (VSLR).

In conclusion, even though the vast majority of them performed well in 2017, most of them performed poorly in 2018. Definitely, the top picks would have been Enphase Energy (ENPH) or SunrRun (RUN), which were the only green energy stocks that gave high returns for both consecutive years. The best investment would have been to buy a lot of ENPH stock at the beginning of 2017 and hold it through 2018 as it had 129.5% and 81.9% return, respectively. Nevertheless, money could also have been made by buying a put option on TERP at the beginning of 2017 as it returned -7.2% and then in 2018 another -5%.
