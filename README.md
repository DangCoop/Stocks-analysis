# Stocks-analysis
## Project Overview
---
***Background***
Steve asked me to analyze a group of 12 green stocks to support his parentâ€™s investment decisions. To do so, I gladly designed an interactive, user friendly, workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) within Excel to provide each stocks annual volume and return on investment (ROI).

He loved being able to analyze each stock at the click of a button and now wants to expand his research beyond the 12 green stocks.

***Purpose***
